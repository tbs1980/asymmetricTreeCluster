# Asymmetric Tree Clustering

> A code for clustering analysis using asymmetric tree structure

This code builds a kd-tree based on samples chosen from the hyper space. The nodes "self-organise" in a way such that boundaries of nodes aligns closely with the contours of the underlying function. Below is an example.
